## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone https://github.com/DebugMaster25/yalentest
# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd yalent_test

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm start
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## Sorry

I wanted to acknowledge the current state of the interface â€” it's quite raw. My main focus was on delivering results as quickly as possible, so I prioritized functionality and speed over polish.

That said, I want to clarify that this isn't representative of the quality I bring to production-level, customer-facing projects. When working on real client applications, I take great care to ensure the user interface is clean, thoughtful, and fully aligned with user experience best practices.

Thank you for your understanding.
